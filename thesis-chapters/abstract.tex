We introduce a new general-purpose game playing platform for two-player turn-based board games, and an implementation of two perfect-information games, Go and Hex, which can be played on the platform.  Furthermore, we implement four intelligent game-playing agents which each use Monte-Carlo Tree Search as the base of their decision-making algorithm.  Each of these agents are modified using different machine learning approaches which have been proposed as potential improvements on the Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm by previous researchers.  Using our game playing framework and implementations of Go and Hex, we provide a direct, robust comparison of the performance of each of our agents.  We find that, overall, the agent utilizing an artificial neural network to prune the search tree at an exponentially decaying rate provided a consistent, moderate improvement on standard MCTS.  Additionally, we find that an agent utilizing a genetic algorithm as its default policy provides more variable performance, but sometimes provides an even larger boost in performance.
