\begin{abstract}
We introduce a new general-purpose game playing platform for two-player turn-based board games, and an implementation of two perfect-information games, Go and Hex, which can be played on the platform.  Furthermore, we implement four intelligent game-playing agents which each use Monte-Carlo Tree Search as the base of their decision-making algorithm.  Each of these agents are modified using different machine learning approaches which have been proposed as potential improvements on the Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm by by previous researchers.  Using our game playing framework and implementations of Go and Hex, we provide a direct, robust comparison of the performance of each of our agents.
